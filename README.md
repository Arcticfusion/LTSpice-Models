# LTSpice Resources

These are resources that I have made to simulate components in LTSpice. 

Models are based on datasheets and PSpice models. No guarantees that the models behaves has expected.

Resources have been created using instructions from [this tutorial](http://www.simonbramble.co.uk/lt_spice/ltspice_lt_spice_tutorial_6.html) by Simon Bramble.

All datasheets have been found publicly online. You can find the specific referenced files in `references.md`.

To get the original PSpice files, you need access to the PSpice application. You can get a trial [here](https://www.orcad.com/pspice-free-trial). It is only available for Windows machines.
