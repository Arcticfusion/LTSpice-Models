To get the PSpice files, you need access to the PSpice application. OrCAD only makes its library available through the application, but the files can be accessed outside of their application.  You can get a trial for PSpice and this will give you access to the files. You can get the trial (here)[https://www.orcad.com/pspice-free-trial]. It is only available for Windows machines. Typically the application files are installed in `C:\\Cadence\SPB_<version_number>`. While the version may change, the models should not change actual values.
